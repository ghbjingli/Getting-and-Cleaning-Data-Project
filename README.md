This Repo contains materials for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

Project Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
Here are the data for the project:

Project Requirements

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Project Deliverables

1. README.md
	This file
2. CodeBook.md
	A codebook which describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data
3. run_analysis.R
	A R script that performs all the clean up and transformation to generate the final product tidydata.txt file
4. tidydata.txt
	The file containing the final tidy data set
